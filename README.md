# Restaurant Reviews: Stage 1

## Specification
This was my task:
> You have been provided the code for a restaurant reviews website. The
> code has a lot of issues. It’s barely usable on a desktop browser,
> much less a mobile device. It also doesn’t include any standard
> accessibility features, and it doesn’t work offline at all. Your job
> is to update the code to resolve these issues while still maintaining
> the included functionality.

## Instructions
Clone or download the files. In case of downloading - unpack the files. To launch this website you need to:

1. In the folder *mws-restaurant-stage-1*, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. With your server running, open a browser and visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.
